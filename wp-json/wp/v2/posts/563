And you must pay a ransom, typically in Bitcoin, to get access again. While it is not a new crime, it is one of the fastest-growing crimes online. Because it is so lucrative to criminals. And thanks to Covid and Work From Home, more and more businesses are unintentionally opening themselves up to the threat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, it is estimated there are more than a hundred calls to insurers every day relating to problems caused by ransomware. Scary. Unless you take necessary precautions, your business could fall victim at some point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But how do you know you\u2019re not already under attack?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Because here is something most people don\u2019t realize about ransomware.<br><br><\/strong><strong>If a hacker gets access to your systems today\u2026 they will not launch the attack straight away.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can take around 60 to 100 days &#8211; if not longer &#8211; from the time you are breached, to the delivery of ransomware. It is possible that you already have unwanted visitors hiding in your network. Now that is a scary thought. You might be wondering why these cybercriminals spend such a long time launching their attack. They spend weeks or more just looking around, investigating your network for weaknesses, and waiting for just the right time to maximize their profit. Not only that, but weirdly, the longer they take, the harder it is for you to discover them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>So how do you know if you\u2019re under attack?&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>And what do you do if you are?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 4 of the best ways for you (or preferably your IT service partner) to check your network is safe and secure.&nbsp;<strong>This guide is a little more technical than the ones we normally write.&nbsp;<\/strong>We will explain the concepts in a way anyone can understand, of course. But we must tell you about some specific technical things and software that can be signs of an impending attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. CHECK FOR&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>OPEN RDP LINKS<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s an RDP link and how do you open or close it?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don\u2019t want to get too techy here, so put simply, an RDP (or Remote Desktop Protocol) is Microsoft technology that allows a local computer to connect to and control a remote PC over a network or the internet. You are probably utilizing this kind of thing if you\u2019ve had any of your people working from home this year, as it makes remote access a lot easier. But RDP links left open to the internet are a very common route for cybercriminals to enter your network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scan for open RDP ports regularly and utilize multi-factor authentication for your links (multi-factor authentication is where you generate a code on a separate device to prove it is really you). Or have them behind a VPN (Virtual Private Network), which gives you a private network from a public internet connection. This really is a specialist job. Your IT service partner should be able to do it for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. LOOK FOR UNEXPECTED SOFTWARE<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the methods ransomware gangs use to take control of your system is certain software tools. It is important that you use a Network Scanner to check exactly what\u2019s running and who\u2019s running it. Often, cybercriminals will take control of just one PC first, perhaps using a phishing email to persuade someone to click on a bad link without realizing it. Once they have control of one PC, they can then target the entire network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, tools such as AngryIP or Advanced Port Scanner are used to do this. Check your network for tools like these. If they are present and your IT people have not installed them, it is possible you have a problem. Criminals also utilize tools to steal your passwords and login credentials. Tools such as Mimikatz and Microsoft Process Explorer. If you spot anything unfamiliar anywhere in your system, get in touch urgently with your IT support partner, who can investigate further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. MONITOR YOUR ADMINISTRATORS<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your network administrators&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>typically have the authority over which applications are downloaded to your network.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the best way for hackers to download the applications they need? They create a new administrator account for themselves. Then they can download whichever tools they need to compromise your network. You need to be aware of software such as Process Hacker, IOBit Uninstaller, GMER, and PCHunter. These are all legitimate tools that could be used by any IT specialist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wrong hands, they can be dangerous. Hackers can use them to disable your security software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. CHECK FOR DISABLED TOOLS AND SOFTWARE<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Once the cybercriminals have administrator rights, they can locate and disable your security software.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can tell that an attack is close to being launched if Active Directory and your domain controllers are disabled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, any backup data the criminals have found will be corrupted. And any systems that automatically deploy software will also be disabled, to stop your attempts to update your computers after an attack. Something called PowerShell will then be used to spread everything across your network. It is worth remembering that this will all be done slowly. Your hackers will take their time because that makes it much harder to detect them. Many security tools only record traffic for a set period of time and are then reset. This means that there is no data held on the entry. Which disguises the attack until it\u2019s ready to launch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once an attack has been launched and your data held to ransom, most of the time there is little you can do other than an attempt to restore backups. Or pay the ransom. The hackers have normally been so thorough with their preparation that even the best IT security specialists have few options open to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>So, once you have detected that something might be wrong,&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>what can you do to stop an attack from being launched?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This will stop attackers coming in again. And will also cut off their control access.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can force a password change across your core systems, which will also throw your attackers out. However, it is worth noting that this is pointless if your RDP access is not cut off and controlled, as the attackers will just re-enter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monitor your administrator accounts. This may sound like a simple step, but you would be surprised at how often it\u2019s neglected. You should also monitor and limit who can use PowerShell within your organization. Without getting into the details of what<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PowerShell is; just know it\u2019s a powerful tool you don\u2019t want the wrong people playing with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep all your software and security patched and updated. It is very tempting to click \u2018later\u2019 on updates. But saving a little time now is not worth the huge amount of time and money that you will lose should you become the victim of a ransomware attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implement multi-factor authentication across all of your applications, if you haven\u2019t already. This adds another level of security for your network and helps to prevent unauthorized access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, build your security from the ground up, and make sure every member of staff throughout the business \u2013 from CEO to entry-level worker \u2013 has regular security training. If everyone is aware of the risks and how to avoid them, it could stop a potential attack in its tracks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because this is such a highly technical subject, it is not something you or your team should tackle on your own. You need IT, security specialists, to take preventative action and monitor your systems regularly for early signs of problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/biztechmt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/biztechmt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/biztech-solutions-mt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/biztech.solutions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019ve probably heard a lot about ransomware recently.
